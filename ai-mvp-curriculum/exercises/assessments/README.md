# Assessment Systems

This directory contains comprehensive assessment frameworks for evaluating student progress and ensuring learning objectives are met throughout the entire 6-week AI-powered MVP development course.

Our assessment approach focuses on **competency-based evaluation** where students must demonstrate practical skills and real-world application rather than just theoretical knowledge. Each week builds on previous competencies while introducing new challenges.

### Core Assessment Principles
- **Practical Application**: All assessments involve real business outputs
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each week requires mastery of previous skills plus new competencies
- **Peer Learning Integration**: Collaborative assessment enhances individual learning
- **Industry Relevance**: Assessment criteria mirror real-world business standards
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular feedback loops enable rapid skill development
