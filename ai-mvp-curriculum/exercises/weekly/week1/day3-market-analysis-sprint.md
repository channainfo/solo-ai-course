## Exercise 3A: Market Sizing Challenge (25 minutes)

### Your Mission
Calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) for your chosen MVP project using three different methodologies.

### Method 1: Top-Down Analysis (8 minutes)

#### Step 1: Identify Your Market Category (2 minutes)
Choose the market category that best fits your MVP:
- **Content Repurposer:** Content marketing software market
- **AI Email Assistant:** Business communication tools market  
- **SaaS Validator:** Business intelligence/analytics market
- **Social Media Manager:** Social media management tools market
- **Learning Assistant:** EdTech/online learning market

#### Step 2: Find Market Size Data (4 minutes)
Use these research sources to find market data:

**Primary Sources (try these first):**
- Grand View Research
- Statista (if you have access)
- IBISWorld
- Fortune Business Insights

**Secondary Sources:**
- Google "market size [your category] 2024"
- Industry association reports
- Public company annual reports (10-K filings)
- VC/consulting firm reports

**Research Template:**
```
Market Category: ________________
Global Market Size 2024: $_______ billion
Annual Growth Rate: _______% CAGR
Regional Breakdown (if available):
- North America: $_______ billion
- Europe: $_______ billion  
- Asia-Pacific: $_______ billion

Data Source: ________________
Date of Report: ________________
Confidence in Data: ___/10
```

#### Step 3: Calculate TAM/SAM/SOM (2 minutes)

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- Use the global or regional market size you found
- This represents the entire market if you had 100% market share

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**
- Narrow down to your specific segment
- Consider geographic, demographic, or feature limitations
- Typically 10-40% of TAM

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
- Realistic market share you could capture in 3-5 years
- Consider competition, resources, barriers to entry
- Typically 1-10% of SAM for startups

**Calculation Example:**
```
TAM: $15 billion (total content marketing software)
SAM: $3 billion (AI-powered content tools only)
SOM: $150 million (realistic capture: 5% of SAM)
```

### Method 2: Bottom-Up Analysis (8 minutes)

#### Step 1: Define Your Target Customer (2 minutes)
Be specific about who will pay for your product:

**Customer Profile Template:**
```
Primary Customer: ________________
Company Size: ________________
Industry Focus: ________________
Geographic Region: ________________
Title/Role: ________________
Budget Range: $_____ - $_____ per month
```

#### Step 2: Estimate Customer Population (4 minutes)
Research and estimate the total number of your target customers:

**Research Sources:**
- Bureau of Labor Statistics (for job titles)
- Industry association membership data
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (filter by criteria)
- Census Bureau business data
- SimilarWeb for website traffic estimates

**Calculation Worksheet:**
```
Total Companies in Target Industry: ________________
Companies of Target Size: ________________
Geographic Limitation Factor: ____%
Total Potential Company Customers: ________________

OR (for B2C products):
Total Population in Target Demo: ________________
Percentage Who Have This Problem: ____%
Percentage Who Would Pay for Solution: ____%
Total Potential Individual Customers: ________________
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Revenue Potential (2 minutes)

**Formula:**
```
Annual Revenue Potential = 
Target Customers × Average Annual Revenue Per Customer × Market Penetration %

Example:
50,000 small businesses × $300/year × 1% penetration = $150,000
```

**Your Calculation:**
```
Target Customer Count: ________________
Expected Annual Revenue Per Customer: $________________
Realistic Penetration Rate (Year 1): ____%
Realistic Penetration Rate (Year 3): ____%

Year 1 SOM: $________________
Year 3 SOM: $________________
```

### Method 3: Analogous Market Analysis (9 minutes)

#### Step 1: Identify Similar Products (3 minutes)
Find 3-5 existing products that solve similar problems or serve similar customers:

**Similar Product Research:**
```
Product 1: ________________
Company: ________________
Estimated Users: ________________
Pricing: $_____ per month
Public Revenue (if known): $________________

Product 2: ________________
Company: ________________
Estimated Users: ________________
Pricing: $_____ per month
Public Revenue (if known): $________________

Product 3: ________________
Company: ________________

```

#### Step 2: Research Success Stories (3 minutes)
Look for funding announcements, acquisition prices, or revenue reports:

**Success Story Research Sources:**
- Crunchbase for funding data
- TechCrunch acquisition articles
- Company press releases
- Founder interviews mentioning revenue
- SaaS metric websites (like BaremetricOpen)

#### Step 3: Extrapolate Market Potential (3 minutes)
Use competitor success to estimate your potential:

**Analysis Framework:**
```
Most Successful Comparable Company: ________________
Their Estimated Revenue: $________________
Their Market Share (estimated): ____%
Time to Reach This Scale: _____ years

If They Represent ____% of Total Market:
Total Market Size = $________________

Your Realistic Market Share Goal: ____%
Your Revenue Potential = $________________
```
