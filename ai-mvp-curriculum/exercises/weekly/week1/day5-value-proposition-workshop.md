- Gain Creators

### Customer Profile Deep Dive (7 minutes)

#### Jobs to be Done (2 minutes)
What is your customer trying to accomplish? Think functional, emotional, and social jobs.

**Functional Jobs** (what they want to get done):
```
Example: "Create engaging social media content for my restaurant"

## Exercise 5B: One-Liner Competition (15 minutes)

### Round 1: Basic Structure (5 minutes)

#### Formula Framework
Create 5 different one-liners using this structure:

**Template:** "We help [target customer] [achieve outcome] by [unique method]"

```
Version 1: "We help ________________ ________________ by ________________"

Version 2: "We help ________________ ________________ by ________________"

Version 3: "We help ________________ ________________ by ________________"

Version 4: "We help ________________ ________________ by ________________"

Version 5: "We help ________________ ________________ by ________________"
```

#### Alternative Templates
Try these variations:

**Problem-Solution:** "[Customer] struggle with [problem]. [Product] [solution] so they can [benefit]."

**Before-After:** "Instead of [old way], [customers] can now [new way] with [product]."

**Comparison:** "[Product] is like [familiar thing] but for [specific use case]."

### Round 2: Clarity Testing (5 minutes)

#### Stranger Test Protocol
Test each one-liner with someone unfamiliar with your project:

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Read one-liner to them once
2. Ask: "What do you think this product does?"
3. Ask: "Who do you think would use this?"
4. Ask: "How clear was that on a scale of 1-10?"
5. Note their exact words

**Testing Results:**
```
ONE-LINER 1: "________________"
Understanding: ________________
Target Customer: ________________  
Clarity Score: ___/10

ONE-LINER 2: "________________"
Understanding: ________________
Target Customer: ________________
Clarity Score: ___/10

ONE-LINER 3: "________________"
Understanding: ________________
Target Customer: ________________
Clarity Score: ___/10
```

### Round 3: Pitch Battle (5 minutes)

#### Elevator Pitch Development
Expand your best one-liner into a 30-second elevator pitch:

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (5 seconds): Attention-grabbing opening
2. **Problem** (10 seconds): The pain you solve
3. **Solution** (10 seconds): How you solve it uniquely
4. **Proof** (5 seconds): Evidence it works

**Your 30-Second Pitch:**
```
HOOK (5 sec): "________________"

PROBLEM (10 sec): "________________"

SOLUTION (10 sec): "________________"

PROOF (5 sec): "________________"
```

#### Pitch Practice Protocol
Practice with a partner using this format:

**Round 1:** Deliver pitch, partner times and gives feedback
**Round 2:** Incorporate feedback, deliver again
**Round 3:** Final version with confidence scoring

**Feedback Categories:**
- Clarity: Was the problem/solution clear?
- Interest: Would they want to know more?
- Believability: Does the solution seem realistic?
- Memorability: Would they remember this later?

## Exercise 5C: Messaging Optimization (5 minutes)

### Weekend Preparation
Prepare for Monday's final presentation:
- [ ] Refine your elevator pitch based on feedback
- [ ] Create 3-5 slide presentation (problem/solution/traction)
