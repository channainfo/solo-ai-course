## Exercise 9B: Error Handling & Reliability (15 minutes)

### Challenge 1: Graceful Failure Management (8 minutes)

#### Task: Build Robust Error Handling Systems
Ensure your AI integration fails gracefully and provides helpful fallbacks.

**Error Handling Framework:**
```
ERROR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

API Error Categories:
1. Rate Limiting (429 errors)
2. Authentication Issues (401/403 errors)  
3. Input Validation Errors (400 errors)
4. Server Errors (500+ errors)
5. Network/Timeout Errors
6. Content Policy Violations

Response Strategy by Error Type:

RATE LIMITING:
User Message: "High demand right now! Trying again in 30 seconds..."
System Action: Implement exponential backoff
Fallback: Queue request for retry
User Experience: Show progress indicator

AUTHENTICATION:
User Message: "Connection issue with AI service. Our team has been notified."
System Action: Log error, alert administrator
Fallback: Disable AI features temporarily

- Identify batchable requests
- Send combined API call
- Distribute responses to individual users

Benefits:
- Reduced API costs (fewer calls)
- Improved response times (parallel processing)
- Better rate limit management
```

**Cost Optimization:**
```
COST MANAGEMENT

Token Usage Optimization:
- Trim unnecessary context from prompts
- Use shorter models for simple tasks
- Implement prompt compression techniques
- Monitor token usage per user/request

Model Selection Strategy:
- GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks
- GPT-3.5-turbo for basic content generation
- Fine-tuned models for specific use cases
- Local models for privacy-sensitive tasks

Usage Monitoring:
