## Security & Privacy Rules

### Data Access Rules

#### User Data
```
Rule: Users can only see their own profile data
When: Current User = This User
Exception: Team admins can see team member profiles
```

#### Project Data
```
Rule: Users can only see projects they're members of
When: Current User is in This Project's Team's Members
Exception: System admins see all projects
```

#### Task Data
```
Rule: Users see tasks in their team projects
When: Current User is in This Task's Project's Team's Members
Write: Users can only edit tasks assigned to them or created by them
Exception: Project admins can edit all project tasks
```

When: Current User is in This Team's Members
Write: Only team owners can modify team settings
```

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimization
```
Indexes:
- User: email (unique)
- Task: status, assigned_to, due_date
- Project: team, status
- Daily_Standup: date, team

Search Strategies:
- Use "contains" sparingly
- Prefer exact matches on indexed fields
- Limit results with ":first item" or specific counts
- Cache frequently accessed data
```

### API Optimization
```
Rate Limiting:
- Max 10 AI requests per user per hour
- Cache AI responses for similar requests
- Batch multiple task suggestions

Error Handling:
- Fallback to manual task creation if AI fails
- Store failed requests for retry
- Graceful degradation of AI features
```

## Testing Scenarios

### User Acceptance Testing

#### Project Creation Flow
```
Test Case 1: Basic project creation
1. User creates new project
2. Enters project details
3. AI suggests task breakdown
4. User accepts suggestions
5. Verify tasks created correctly

Expected Result: Project created with AI-suggested tasks

Test Case 2: AI suggestion rejection
1. User creates project
2. AI suggests tasks
3. User rejects all suggestions
4. User creates manual tasks
5. Verify manual task creation works

Expected Result: Project created with manual tasks only
```

#### Daily Standup Generation
```
Test Case 1: Automatic standup
1. Team has active tasks
2. Some tasks completed yesterday
3. Automated standup runs
4. Verify report accuracy

Expected Result: Accurate standup report generated

Test Case 2: No activity standup
1. Team has no recent activity
2. Standup generation runs
3. Verify appropriate "no activity" message

Expected Result: Graceful handling of inactive teams
```
