## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Information Overload
**Solution:** Focus on learning just what you need for your specific MVP. Use the "parking lot" technique for interesting but non-essential learnings.

### Challenge: Analysis Paralysis
**Solution:** Set strict time boxes for research. Remember: launch and learn beats perfect planning.

### Challenge: Technical Overwhelm
**Solution:** Start with one tool at a time. Master basics before advanced features.

### Challenge: Imposter Syndrome
**Solution:** Everyone starts somewhere. Focus on progress, not perfection. Use community support.
