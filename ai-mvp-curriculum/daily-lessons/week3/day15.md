## AI Integration Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering Tips
```
Good Prompt Structure:
1. Role definition ("You are a...")
2. Context provision ("Given this information...")
3. Task specification ("Your task is to...")
4. Output format ("Respond in this format...")
5. Constraints ("Do not include...")

Example:
"You are a helpful project manager. Given this project description: [PROJECT_DESC] and team skills: [SKILLS], create 5 specific tasks. Format as numbered list with time estimates. Keep tasks under 8 hours each."
```

### Cost Management
```
Strategies:
- Use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks
- Cache frequently requested content
- Implement request deduplication
- Set monthly spending limits
- Monitor usage patterns

Budget Planning:
- Development: $50-100/month
- Launch: $100-200/month
- Scale: Monitor and adjust
```

### Error Handling Patterns
```
Graceful Degradation:
1. Try AI feature
2. If fails, show cached response
3. If no cache, show manual option
4. Log error for debugging
5. Notify user appropriately

User Communication:
- "AI is thinking..." (loading)
- "AI unavailable, showing alternatives" (error)
- "This suggestion is AI-generated" (transparency)
```
